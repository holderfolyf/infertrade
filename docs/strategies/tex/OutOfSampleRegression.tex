\ruledescription{Out of Sample Regression is an enhanced version of \href{https://github.com/ta-oliver/infertrade/blob/main/docs/strategies/pdf/SignalRegression.pdf}{Signal Regression}. This strategy is a regression based approach that is used to forecast change in prices using signal values generated from technical indicators. Using this strategy we split data set in to two sets, in-sample and out-sample. In-sample set is used to learn model parameters while out-sample set is used to evaluate the error. The error results better depict the performance of regressors in a real world scenario and warns investors of any possibility of over-fitting.}
