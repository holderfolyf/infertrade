\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
\position_\currenttime = k_1*R_t+k_2
\end{equation}
\\ % creates some space after equation
with

$\position_\currenttime$ is the portfolio allocation at time $\currenttime$

$R_t$: Research value at time $\currenttime$

$k_1$: level coefficient

$k_2$: static coefficient
