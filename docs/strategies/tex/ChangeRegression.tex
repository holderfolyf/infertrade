\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
\position_\currenttime = k_{1}\left(\frac{R_t}{R_{t-1}}-1\right)+k_2
\end{equation}
\\ % creates some space after equation
with:

$\position_\currenttime$: is the portfolio allocation at time $\currenttime$

$R_t$: Research value at time $\currenttime$

$R_{t-1}$: Research value at time $\currenttime -1$  

$k_1$: level coefficient

$k_2$: static coefficient
