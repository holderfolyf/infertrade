\section{Equation}
Below are the equations which govern how this specific trading rule calculates a trading position.

\begin{equation}
\position_\currenttime = k_1*R_t +k_2*(\frac{R_t}{R_{t-1}}-1)+k_3
\end{equation}
\\ % creates some space after equation
where:

$\position_\currenttime$: is the portfolio allocation at time $\currenttime$

$R_t$: Research value at time $\currenttime$

$k_1$: Level Coefficient

$k_2$: Change Coefficient

$k_3$: Constant Coefficient
